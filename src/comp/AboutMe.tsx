            Growing up I always wanted my devices to do particular things,
            however I didn't always have the best things, so I made it work. I
            would teach myself how to install new apps on outdated phones,
            jailbreak game systems, and even build my own gameboy-like hand
            held. Without knowing Iâ€™ve learned when there's a will, there's a
            way, and many of these skills have translated directly into being a
            web-developer.
